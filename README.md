This guide will help you use my project for your database needs.

Here's how to get started:

Open your SQL application and create a new database.
Open the "table file" included in this project and run the code to create the tables in your database.
Open the "table values file" and run the code to populate the tables with data.
Open the "queries" folder and run each query file one by one to see the results.
Client Requests and Queries:

The "demand files" folder contains information about client requests and the corresponding queries used to fulfill those requests.

Using Draw.io:

To view the project's database schema visually, you can use an online diagramming tool like Draw.io.

Search for "Draw.io" on Google and open the website.
Once you have Draw.io open, you can then open the project's schema file to see the database structure.
